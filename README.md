# Synaptic Surge

The project, *Synaptic Surge*, is designed with the aim of educating users about everything related to biohacking. The information will be distilled into manageable segments to counteract the *information overload* that many visitors might experience on similar sites. This platform caters to both novices interested in exploring the world of biohacking and seasoned veterans seeking to refine their knowledge in specific areas. In addition, a newsletter sign-up will be available to keep subscribers updated on any new scientific developments relevant to the topic at hand.

This repository is a clone of the original project that I submitted to the Code Institute. You can view the original project as it was at the time of submission at the following link: https://github.com/CharlieMcGoldrick/ci-ms1-synaptic-surge.

I have cloned this project to continue developing and expanding on it. As I make updates and improvements, they will be pushed to this repository, allowing the site to evolve beyond its initial submission state.

<summary><h4>Competition</h4></summary>

I have found a variety of sites that include information on Biohacking; [Biohackers Lab](https://www.biohackerslab.com/), [David Asprey](https://daveasprey.com/), [Biohacking Collective](https://biohackingcollective.com/), [Found My Fitness](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/), [Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com/), and [Ben Greenfield Life](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/). Many of them seem to revolve around a personality, which gives the information on the site more credibility. This would be difficult to compete with currently, however, with a successful, monetizable site I could hire scientific professionals to give *Synaptic Surge* more credence. When in comes to design the sites have several strengths and weaknesses:

[Biohackers Lab](https://www.biohackerslab.com/)

Strengths

- Clean and organised layout
- Good colour contrast between the orange and white
- Has a variety of content; text, images, videos & podcasts

Weaknesses

- Navbar isn't sticky which requires unnecessary scrolling to navigate the site
- Sections could be broken up with more colours instead of being white
- Poor colour contrast on certain pages between black and orange. Should be orange and white
- Generally responsive but fonts seem to big on mobile and the content could be broken up more

[David Asprey](https://daveasprey.com/)

Strengths

- Authoritative site due to it being linked with David Asprey (*Father of Biohacking*)
- Hover interactions on all elements
- High quality images

Weaknesses

- Black and yellow lines on homepage don't really work. I understand that it's part of his book *Smarter Not Harder* but it doesn't fit the otherwise clean blue and white colour scheme
- Articles could be broken up into sub-categories
- Generally responsive but navigation doesn't display properly on mobile

[Biohacking Collective](https://biohackingcollective.com/)

Strengths

- Responsive
- Good colour contrast

Weaknesses

- Poor layout, it's difficult to find specific information

[Found My Fitness](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/)

Strengths

- Authoritative site due to it's link with Dr. Rhonda Patrick
- Responsive
- Good colour contrast
- Clean and organised layout

Weaknesses

- Limited interaction on elements leave it feeling a bit data
- A lot of scrolling on mobile when looking at 'Topics' articles

[Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com/)

Strengths

- Minimalist design focused on content
- Text, images & videos
- Responsive

Weaknesses

- Poor contrast on hover elements

[Ben Greenfield Life](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/)

Strengths

- Good colour scheme
- Text, images, videos, podcasts

Weaknesses

- Poor contrast on hover elements
- Difficult to find sought after information on mobile
- A lot of scrolling to find certain articles

Many of these sites produce podcasts, which is currently an unattainable content feature. However, I believe there is a potential niche in the podcast space for anecdotal podcasts, where I would interview users of *Synaptic Surge* and listen to their Biohacking experiences. This approach has proven successful with content creators such as:

- Dr Anthony Chaffe - His focus is on the Carnivore Diet and its myriad of benefits
- Jake Steiner - His focus is on eyesight, specifically managing and even reversing myopia
Dr Chaffe also interviews scientific peers, but I believe his interviews with regular people are quite powerful, as are Jake's, because it makes the subject matter more relatable.

In addition to the sites focused specifically on biohacking, there are other platforms like Healthline and Medical News Today that cover a broader range of topics, including biohacking. These websites generally have a clear and intuitive design, with well-structured content. However, they can sometimes overwhelm users with an excessive amount of information. To improve the user experience, it would be beneficial for these sites to break down their content into more manageable chunks, while still providing clear information. This can be achieved by utilising techniques that reduce visual clutter, such as using collapsible sections, implementing clear headings and subheadings, and incorporating interactive elements that allow users to explore the content at their own pace. By presenting information in a more digestible format, these websites could enhance usability and make it easier for users to find the specific information they are looking for.

<summary><h4>Competition Revisited</h4></summary>
I have decided to revisit the strategy plane after working on the scope. Biohacking is a vast topic, and I believe I should start with a smaller vertical slice so that the site has a strong focus to begin with and then can be expanded once that area is covered (*The long WOW!*). I have decided to focus on Nootropics as it's an area that I believe isn't as well known as other areas of Biohacking such as nutrition, exercise, and sleep.

The competition for this specific area features a variety of different sites; [Braintropic](https://www.braintropic.com/), [Neurohacker](https://neurohacker.com/), [Quantified Bob](https://www.quantifiedbob.com/), and [Nootriment](https://nootriment.com/). Compared to the Biohacking sites, these Nootropic sites don't have a focus on personalities but instead on education with links to scientific studies. This is more in line with what I had in mind for the MVP of *Synaptic Surge*. I think [Braintropic](https://www.braintropic.com/) and [Nootriment](https://nootriment.com/) do a great job of presenting information in a coherent, structured way, but this could still be improved, especially on mobile.

    <summary><h3>Surface</h3></summary>

<h4>Fonts</h4>

Headings - [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=Roboto+Slab)
I'm going with Roboto Slab for my headings. It's a cool mix of modern and classic, and it's got a style that really stands out. Plus, it's easy for anyone to read.

Body Text - [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=Open+Sans)
For everything else, I'm using Open Sans. It's incredibly versatile, and it looks good on any device. It's simple, friendly, and really easy to read - just what I need for my site's main text.

<h4>Colours</h4>

![Synaptic Surge Colour Swatch](assets/images/readme/uxd/surface/synaptic_surge_colour_swatch.png)

- #0A1936 (Dark Navy Blue): I could use this as my primary color. It's great for major elements like the header, footer, or primary background color. I can also use it for important text.
- #B6BDE5 (Light Pastel Blue): This light and airy color could serve as a background color for certain sections to provide contrast with the darker blue. It's also a good color for secondary text, borders, or backgrounds of cards or insets where I want the content to stand out.
- #D3A518 (Dark Goldenrod): This is a strong, vibrant color that can serve as a highlight or accent color. I can use it for calls to action, buttons, or other elements I want to draw attention to. As it's quite a rich color, using it sparingly can make my design pop without being overpowering.
- #F1F1E6 (Very Pale Yellow): This very light color is excellent for backgrounds, especially if I want a slightly warmer tone than pure white. I can also use it for elements like tooltips, drop-down menus, or modals where I want a contrast with the main page.

<summary><h2>Features</h2></summary>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
Each page features a responsive navigation bar with the brand name on the left and brand logo in the middle. To the right are the other navigational elements; About & Supplements. About & Supplements can be hovered over to reveal more navigation items.

On mobile, the brand logo is on the left and the brand name is hidden. On the right is a hamburger menu which reveals the navigation menu when touched.

<h3>Hero Section</h3>
Each page has a hero section that often has a heading and then a small paragraph related to the page that the user is on. There are footnotes that open up in a new tab, linking to scientific studies to back up the cliams. There is a call to action button on each hero section which takes the user further down the page.

On the about page there are three CTA buttons so the user can quickly navigate to nootropics, minerals or vitamins.

For the specific supplement pages, the heading and paragraph is replace by a table that features the relevant supplement and a few highlights about it.

<h3>Dropdown Section</h3>
Each page has a dropdown section which the CTA buttons on the hero section take the user to. In this section the user can interact with the dropdowns to see the content that they wish to see.

On the home page the user can switch the content between the popular supplements provided.

On the about page, the information on this page is static and it has a paragraph and video educating the user about Biohacking.

On the general supplement page there are three dropdown sections, so the user can choose content whether they're interesting in nootropics, minerals or vitamins.

Finally, on the specific supplement pages the user can switch between: overview, functionality, benefits, side effects, drug interactions and dosage. Each specific supplement has a CTA to purchase the relevant supplement.

<h3>Footer</h3>
Each page has a footer which contains a form (with form validation) that users can fill out to join Synaptic Surge's newsletter. When a user fills this page out they are taken to a thank you page. Below the form are the social media icosn which open on another page.

<h3>Thank You Page</h3>
When the form is submitted the user is taken to the thank you page, where they can navigate back to the homepage with a button.

<h3>Performance & Accessibility</h3> 
I used [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and all pages passed with 0 errors. I also used [Google Lighthouse](hhttps://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) and every page was in the high greens for performance, accessbility and best practises.

<h3>Testing</h3>
1. I have tested the functionality. All of the links go to the desired locations and the link hover styles work. If the link is external then it opens up on another page. The navbar slides down when it's hovered and the hamburger menu opens when using a touch scrren. The form submits on all pages and the user is greeted with a thank you page that has a button to take them back.
2. The website works as intended on Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
3. I've tested the website on a laptop (1366x766px) and a Samsung Galaxy S9 (360x740px).
